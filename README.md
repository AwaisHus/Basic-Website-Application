# FlowerShop_Website
I've developed a basic website with a strong emphasis on functionality and user management, dedicated to a flower shop where customers can purchase flowers. 

Users can add flowers to their cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.

The website is constructed using:

- HTML: Responsible for defining the website's structure, creating hyperlinks, and shaping the web content.
- CSS with Open-Source Bootstrap: Utilized to enhance the website's styling and aesthetics.
- PHPMyAdmin: This tool is used to maintain a database of both users and administrators.
- PHP: Handles various functions, including page navigation and establishing connections between the website and the PHPMyAdmin database.

Additionally, I've implemented an admin panel, which is exclusively accessible via admin logins. Within this panel, administrators have the authority to modify user logins or remove them from the database, offering robust control over user management.
